Texturized epoxy  layers can make these  floorings  a lot more slip-resistant,  yet they don&#39;t last  for life. They  require to be reapplied every few years,  as well as they can  occupy to five days to cure.</p>

<p>Polycuramine is  one more  alternative,  however it is much cheaper  and also almost as  resilient as epoxy. It  is very important to  keep in mind that polycuramine is a  fairly new  item,  as well as its  real lifespan is not known. However, it is  very reliable for  a minimum of two years. For  contrast, a  top quality epoxy for your garage  will certainly last for  5 years or  even more. The downside to polycuramine is the  cost. A high-quality epoxy will cost at least three times  much more.</p>
